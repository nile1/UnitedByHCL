 (indiN) Indoor Intelligent Navigation  

As stated in our Workflow diagram and the Idea document, we are providing a working model of all the modules stated with their deployement instructions. 

Few of these are open source projects and the rest are made by us. These working modules can be considered as a prototype/ POC of our idea presented. 

Although all these modules work independently, but the real strength of our proposed system is in how we are integrating them so as every module is acting 
as an correction module to one another.

Once selected, we can build and provide a sigle APK file having all these modules integrated, or upon the wishes of the organizer about which all they require.

Module 1 :  Wifi Indore Positioning System
Module 2 :  Bluetooth Indore Positioning System
Module 3 :  Dead Reckoning using Pedometer & Compass
Module 4 :  Phone Position module with respective to Human body to estimate step Length and improve Module 3.
